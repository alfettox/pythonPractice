the respectable class. Fig. 1 represents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were bending 
over him from above; figs. 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman, as you would see him if your eye were 
close to the level, or all but on the level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level 
of the table (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing but a straight line. """
